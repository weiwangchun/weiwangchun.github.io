  <p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3253208">  Working Paper: Resale Options and Cryptocurrency Mispricing </a></p>
  <p> We examine the predictions of the resale option hypothesis (Scheinkman and Xiong, 2003) in cryptocurrency markets. The resale option hypothesis yields testable implications on the relationship between the level and volatility of mispricing, and the degree of heterogeneous beliefs. Using turnover as a proxy for heterogeneity, we ﬁnd evidence supporting the resale option hypothesis. These ﬁndings are persistent across various types of cryptocurrencies, and support the notion that cryptocurrencies trade above intrinsic value. Futhermore, we conduct two backtests to show that portfolios with higher turnover or resale option characteristics underperform portfolios with lower turnover or resale option characteristics. This supports the theory that disagreement is negatively related to future returns for positive biased assets (see Atmaz and Basak, 2018). </p>
  
  <p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3175876">Published Paper: The impact of Tether grants on Bitcoin</a></p>
  <p> In recent years, Tether issuances (or 'grants') have increased significantly, which correlated broadly with a significant rise in Bitcoin valuation. This paper examines the impact of cryptocurrency issuances on subsequent cryptocurrency returns. It is argued that as Tether is the undisputed 'stable coin', the minting of new Tether acts similarly to monetary expansion in cryptocurrency markets, inflating the prices of Bitcoin. We construct a VAR model and show contrary to investor expectations, Tether issuances do not impact subsequent Bitcoin returns, however, they do impact traded volumes. We also document an increase in Tether trading following a subsequent decrease in Bitcoin returns. This illustrates investor preferences for lower volatility crypto-assets in periods following negative Bitcoin returns. </p>
