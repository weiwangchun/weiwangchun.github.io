  <h1> Research Interests </h1>

  <p> Equities Investing // Quantitative Research // Portfolio Construction // Risk Management <br />
I am a lecturer at  UQ Business School with research interests in empirical asset pricing. Prior to academia, I have more than 8 years experience in funds management. I spent circa 3 years as a quantitative analyst at Macquarie Investment Management in their systematic equities team and 3.5 years at Regal Funds Management as a quantitative analyst with their systematic long short portfolios in Sydney. I also spent 2 years as a macro and portfolio construction investment analyst at AustralianSuper in Melbourne. </p>
